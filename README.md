Investly — Private Investment Discovery Platform

Investly is a curated, compliance-aware investment discovery & community platform focused on surfacing high-signal private opportunities.
It is designed as a trust-first, education-led private network, not an open marketplace or trading platform.

The platform prioritizes:

Quality over volume

Curation over listings

Signal over hype

Community before capital

Note: This repository reflects the current production code synced with Lovable.

🧠 Core Concept

Investly does not directly facilitate investments or transactions

It acts as a technology & discovery layer

Opportunities are vetted, structured, and presented for informed decision-making

Access is intentionally gated to maintain signal quality
